		<h1 class="title">The Thing</h1>
		<pre id="content">	Phil baker had been at Preston university for six years, teaching science and microbiology. It was good pay, and the climate in South Carolina was very nice, but he hardly ever used his days off to spend leisure time at the beach or any other outdoor activities. Science was something he loved scenic he was very young and he was fascinated with the way he could observe and sometimes manipulate microscopic organisms. 
			Phil never had time for sports or band, and only went on one date his senior year with a girl named Haley.  Phil wasn't interested in girls, but Haley was very different. Most kids in high school didn't have a true interest in science, but Haley was the exception, like Phil. It was actually a good first date, and they spent most of their time discussing their different science projects and findings. After that prom date, Phil never saw her again except in class, and then they both went separate ways in college.
	Phil was excited when he was offered a teaching position a Preston, being top of his class he could have chosen many places, but liked that the college had the top science department in the country. 
	Six years went too fast, and school cutbacks meant that half of the staff were let go.  Phil was disappointed, but at the same time this gave him time to peruse his own science research on his own. 
	Phil applied for, and received a grant for research on developing a new type of microbots, able to be used for repairing damaged blood vessels, muscle repair or mending  broken bones inside the human body, all without any surgery.
This is cutting edge technology, and the government gave him a blank check as long as he showed results within two years.</pre>
